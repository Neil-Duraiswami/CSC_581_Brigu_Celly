# ABC Healthcare's New Patient Management System

[Presentation](https://youtu.be/l9v1aOI4bTI)

ABC Healthcare, a network of hospitals and clinics, is experiencing significant growth and finding it increasingly challenging to manage patient records using its outdated system. The current system is slow, lacks integration with other departments, and does not provide real-time data, leading to delays and errors in patient care management.

To address these issues, ABC Healthcare has decided to develop a new Patient Management System (PMS). The objectives of the new PMS are to:

1. Improve the speed and efficiency of patient record management.
2. Integrate seamlessly with departments such as billing, pharmacy, and diagnostics.
3. Provide real-time data and analytics for better decision-making and patient care.
4. Ensure scalability to support future growth.

ABC Healthcare has formed a project team comprising software developers, business analysts, a project manager, and representatives from the affected departments. They have chosen to follow the Agile methodology to develop the new system.
